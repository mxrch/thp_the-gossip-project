# The Hacking Project - The Gossip Project


## :mag: The content
In these exercises, I had to make a gossip site and put it online on Heroku.

The live version is available on Heroku here : https://mxrch-the-gossip-project.herokuapp.com/


**After cloning the repository, make sure to do :**
```sh
$ cd thp_the-gossip-project
$ bundle install
```

You can also generate random data in the database by doing :
```sh
$ rails db:seed
```

This will install all the dependencies needed for the exercises.
