# The Hacking Project - The Gossip Project


## :mag: The content
In these exercises, I had to do **a gossip site**.

***This includes :***
* Users,
* Gossips,
* Comments,
* and replies.


**The live version : https://mxrch-the-gossip-project.herokuapp.com/**

**After cloning the repository, make sure to do :**
```sh
$ cd thp_the-gossip-project
$ bundle install
```

This will install all the dependencies needed for the exercises.
